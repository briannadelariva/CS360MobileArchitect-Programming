# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The application I chose to create was a weight tracking app which was created on Android Studio. The requirements for this app was to create a user-friendly interface that allowed users to input and keep track of their daily weight, create a new user, log in, and receive a pop-up message reminding the user to input their weight. The user needs was to have a way to maintain their weight and keep track of their progross towards their goal weight. 

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The necessary screens and features for this UI included having a main login screen, a login button, and a create new user button. After the login, a secondary screen would appear with an immediate pop up message reminding the user to input their daily weights. A button allowing a user to "add weight" is also visible, allowing the user to input a number and have it appear on the UI as a grid so the user can have data visualization on their weight tracking journey. The UI design kept user in mind by ensuring the layout of features were user-friendly (big buttons, contrasting colors between button and background screen, etc). I believe the designs were successful because it allowed for simplistic ease of use for the user by having each feature clearly available by button use. 


# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approached the process of coding the application by frequently reviewing the app guidelines and requirements, this ensured that each aspect was being met and I would not miss detail. I planned out each step on paper first for a simple visual step-by-step guide before coding on Android Studio itself. I believe this is a strategy I will use in the future for other application development because it helps give a briefing on how to get started.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Testing code functionality is important to reveal any errors and ensure the code is fulfulling all requirements necessary. The method in which I tested my code included frequently using the debugging tool within Android studio to catch any errors, and simulating through the application on the Android Emulator to see first-hand how the application performed. These strategies helped identify errors and solve issues within the code early to ensure there was a successful launch. 

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
An aspect I believe I had to overcome a challenge and be innovative was with the SMS notification feature. I discovered some difficulty within the SMS feature connecting the button to a specific UI for the user to input their phone number and receive one. I had resulted to Youtube Tutorials, Android Developers website tutorials, and more to help try figuring this portion out. However, it was able to be achieved in a similar format through a pop up message format for the user. 


# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe the pop up message component on the application was a success I was particularly proud of. This feature was displayed as a Reminder for the user to input their daily weight once they logged into the application. I believe this was a unique aspect to the application yet necessary to help aid in user weight tracking success.
